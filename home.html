<center><h2> Vivere Azure Resort </h2></center>
    <p>Tucked by the mountainside of Anilao, Batangas is a private paradise, once the home to a humble family and now can be home to the rest of the world.

        A 2.5-hour drive from Manila and situated by the beautiful cerulean seas of Luzon’s diving capital of the Philippines, Vivere Azure is an idyllic treat to the senses. We are surrounded by lush greenery and azure waters, where a teeming marine life abounds. The rugged terrain and rocky shorefront belie a colorful marine sanctuary flocked by divers and tourists from around the world.
        
        Vivere Azure takes “home away from home” to heart, as it was once a rest house, where memories of childhood and family getaways pepper every nook and cranny. Here we invite you to make memories of your own.
        
        You are our house guest, and we are glad to have you stay with us in our humble abode</p>
